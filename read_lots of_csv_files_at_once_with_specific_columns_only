With this code, we can read many CSV files using their path and OS, and we can also specify what are exactly the columns we want.
it means we canupload csv files at once with initial filtring
## Code_python ##

import pandas as pd
import os

data_files = os.listdir('/home/samt/fati/rich_poor/')  # we use the path of the files we want to upload

def load_file(files):
    for file in files:
        yield pd.read_csv(file,  usecols = [''columns' names that we are interested in"] )
		
data = pd.concat(load_file(datafiles))
